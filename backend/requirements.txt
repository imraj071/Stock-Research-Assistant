fastapi==0.115.0

# the ASGI server that actually runs FastAPI. The [standard] extra includes uvloop and httptools which make it significantly faster than the minimal install.
uvicorn[standard]==0.30.6

#ORM for database interactions. The [asyncio] extra enables async engine support which is mandatory since we're building a fully async backend.
sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.35

#the async PostgreSQL driver. SQLAlchemy doesn't talk to Postgres directly — it needs a driver underneath. asyncpg is the fastest async option available.
asyncpg==0.29.0

#database migration tool. Every schema change gets tracked as a migration file. This is how you evolve your database schema without dropping and recreating tables.
alembic==1.13.2

#manages your config from .env file with type validation. If POSTGRES_PORT is missing or not an integer, it fails loudly at startup rather than silently at runtime.
pydantic-settings==2.5.2

#structured logging. Instead of plain text logs like "Server started", you get JSON like {"event": "server_started", "env": "development", "timestamp": "..."}. Searchable, parseable, production-grade.
structlog==24.4.0

#Python Redis client for APScheduler state persistence later.
redis==5.0.8

# JWT token creation and verification. Used  for auth.
python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0

#password hashing. Never store plain text passwords. bcrypt is the industry standard.
passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4

# rate limiting middleware for FastAPI. Protects your AI endpoints from being hammered.
slowapi==0.1.9

# testing framework.
pytest==8.3.3

#allows pytest to run async test functions. Without this, async tests simply don't work.
pytest-asyncio==0.24.0

#async HTTP client used in tests to make requests to your FastAPI app without spinning up a real server.
